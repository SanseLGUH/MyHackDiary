# 🧠 MyHackDiary

Welcome to **MyHackDiary** — a personal learning project where I dive into reverse engineering, cheat development, and general hacking concepts (for educational purposes only).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> 🛑 **This project is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only.**
> I do not support or promote cheating in online multiplayer games or unauthorized tampering with software.
> Everything here is about **learning**, **understanding systems**, and **exploring how things work under the hood**.

## 📚 What You'll Find

- Memory scanning & pattern searching
- Static/dynamic analysis examples
- Toy cheat loaders/trainers for offline games
- Notes on tools like Ghidra, IDA, Cheat Engine, etc.
- My own experiments with:
  - DLL injection
  - Patching binaries
  - Hooking functions
  - Anti-debug techniques

Some of these might be weird or broken — that's part of the process.

## 🧪 Why This Exists

This is my personal hacking lab where I:

- Practice reverse engineering techniques
- Learn about internals of programs and operating systems
- Explore how cheats are made (and detected)
- Improve my systems programming and debugging skills

## 🔧 Technologies / Tools I Use

- Rust / C++
- Cheat Engine
- Ghidra / IDA Free
- x64dbg / WinDbg
- Windows APIs, memory manipulation, PE structure

## 🚧 Warning

- This repo may contain unstable, unsafe, or experimental code
- Use caution if building or running anything here
- You are responsible for how you use this knowledge
